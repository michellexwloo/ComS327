This project is built from the professor's Assignment 1.07 solution.
The codes for this project are in "pokemon.h", "pokemon.cpp", "io.cpp", and "poke327.cpp".

At the beginning of the program, it will show 3 random Pokemons where user is needs to choose one.
After user has chose their Pokemon, it will show the stats of the chosen Pokemon.
A random number (maximum 6) of Pokemons are given to the generated trainers. When user encountered a trainer, it will show all the Pokemons that trainer has.
User also has a 10% chance to encounter a random wild Pokemon while exploring in tall grass areas.
The level of the trainers' Pokemons and the wild Pokemons vary, depending on the distance from the center of the map.
