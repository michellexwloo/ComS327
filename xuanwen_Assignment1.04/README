This project is built from the professor's Assignment 1.03 solution.
The codes for this project are written in "poke327.c".

The new implementations of this project is to spawn different types of NPCs and move them based on their own movement costs and turns.

To specify the number of NPCs, run the program using "./poke327 --numtrainers #', where # is the total number of NPCs to be spawn.
The program will at least spawn 1 hiker and 1 rival. Then, the remaining number of NPCs (including new hiker and rival) will be spawned randomly.

This program runs in an infinite loop until the user kills it or a segmentation fault occurs. In the loop, the NPCs will be moving according to the rules while the PC remains at the same spot.
