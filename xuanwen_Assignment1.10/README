This program mimics the 2048 game.

How to run:
	> make
	> ./2048


Description:
After starting the game, use wasd keys to move in the 4 corresponding directions (up, left, down, right).
	- Valid move: At least one block on the game board can move in the direction the user chose.
Blocks of the same value will sum up and merge.
After each valid move, a new block of either value 2 or 4 will be spawned at a empty cell randomly.
The goal is to create a 2048 block. When a first 2048 block is created, user can choose to continue playing or quit.
The game ends when there is no possible moves, meaning the game board is full and there is no neighboring blocks of the same number.

Logic of new block value:
The value is determined by the result of 2 ^ (row % 2 + 1). 
This expression ensures that the generated value is either 2 or 4 based on whether the row index is even or odd. 
If row is even (0 or 2), the value will be 2 (since 2^(0+1) = 2), and if row is odd (1 or 3), the value will be 4 (since 2^(1+1) = 4).
