Project explanation:

The codes are written in 'Assignment1.01.c'. 
The program runs to generate a map of size 80 x 21 units, consisting of a border, randomly generated regions, a Pokemon Center, a Pokemart, 4 gates and connecting paths.
The idea of generating terrains is to have a middle point and treat it as the 4 different corners of a square. Utilizing random values, each of the squares are different sizes, so it avoids making an exact square.
After randomly generating required regions(tall grass, water, clearings), some rocks & boulders and trees are scattered on the map.
There will be a total of 4 gates, with 1 being generated at each side of the map. All 4 gates will be connected by 2 paths. Random values are added while generating paths to avoid the paths being just 2 straight lines intersecting each other.
Lastly, a Pokemon Center and a Pokemart is randomly spawned with the condition of being spawn at locations reachable by the paths generated earlier.
