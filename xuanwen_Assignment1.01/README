Project explanation:

The codes are written in 'Assignment1.01.c'. 
The program runs to generate a map of size 80 x 21 units. 
The idea of generating terrains is to have a middle point and treat it as the 4 different corners of a square, but each of the squares are different sizes, so it avoids making an exact square.
After generating required regions(tall grass, water, clearings), some rocks and boulders and trees are scattered on the map.
There will be a gate being generated at each side of the map. All 4 gates will be connected by 2 paths. Random values are added while generating paths to avoid the paths being just 2 straight lines intersecting each other.
A Pokemon Center and a Pokemart is randomly spawned with the condition of being spawn by the path.
